						<p>An online headshop with exclusive perks and discounts for BongBabe Holders</p>
						
						</br>
						
						<p>We will have an exclusive marketplace that widely features smokeware artists. We will be paying these artists fairly for their work above the 30-50% standard in the industry. Artists will always be paid a minimum of 50% of MSRP for their work, however in many cases we will be paying more than 50% for these artworks depending on where the artist identifies themselves on the gender/ethnicity/sexuality wage gap. It is a priority to us to help close the wage gap that disproportionately affects minorities. Read more below about why we are taking these actions to create a unique new age headshop. </p>
						
						</br>
						
						<p>My cannabis background is in the head shop world, and during my time in this industry I have seen two main problems:</p>
						
						</br>
						
						<p>1. Artists are not paid fairly for their contributions and have a large barrier to entrance in the trade</p>
						</br>
						<p>If an artist wants to sell their work they have limited options in the marketplace. Traditional websites like Etsy, Shopify, Wix and others integrated payment systems don’t allow the sale of “regulated goods.” Smokeware artists are automatically considered “high-risk businesses.” This classification means regular banking/payment processing practices aren’t available. You can sell pipes on Etsy if you hide the carb and classify them as “tobacco” accessories, but you cannot sell 14/18mm slides, bubblers, bongs, dab tools and other 420 accessories. If you want to have your own website you have to apply for and be accepted by a high-risk business payment processor and gateway. The cheapest of which is $45-$60/month (not even including processing fees). You have to prove your monthly sales to be accepted though, and prove you have a shelf full of product ready to sell. This is a significant barrier to entry, as small businesses and 1/1 creators don’t have the means in some cases to make this work. This leaves creators turning to wholesaling their goods to other companies that can afford to take on these fees. When wholesaling you are creating large batches of goods you sell to a company for 30-50% of what they will turn around and sell the goods for. In most instances these companies don’t even put the creators name next to these works on their site. This leaves artists selling their work for a fraction of the MSRP usually making just enough $ to get by until the next order.</p>
						</br>
						
						<p>2. Mass production overseas is drowning out artists/individuals/small businesses and stealing designs from small creators</p>
						</br>
						<p>Due to the consistent rise in popularity of cannabis there are more and more cannabis adjacent products hitting the market everyday. Many of these goods are produced in mass quantity overseas and shipped to the U.S. The issue isn’t that these items are being created and sold. We all know that where there is money to be made there will almost always be mass manufacturing. The issue is that local artists struggle to compete with this new influx of mass produced goods in the market. Handmade goods take more energy and money to create, and cannot be offered at the much much cheaper prices that mass produced goods can be offered at. The other huge problem in this sphere is copyright problems. Many of my friends in the smokeware industry have had their work mass produced without permission overseas and then sold into the U.S. market. This is not a one off issue. This has affected dozens of artists who have worked tirelessly over years to create designs, who wake up one day and see it being sold for a fraction of their price by the truckload. Examples include but are in no way limited to: Farbod Ceramics Chill Pill Pipe, MudHeadz Avocado Pipe, AwaysAway Pot Head Pipe, Miwak Jr. Pebble Pipe, Yew Yew Geometry Pipes and many more. This is not to say that we won’t offer mass produced goods as we know not everyone can afford to spend $100+ per item, however we will not sell goods that are a replica of artists work. We stand with artists and will prioritize creating opportunities for them.
